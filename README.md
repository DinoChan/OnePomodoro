Pomodoro Technique is a simple and easy time management method, which can effectively improve the efficiency of work or learning, and keep you focused. Its specific steps are:


1. Decide on the task to be done.

2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).

3. Work on the task.

4. End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.

5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (5 minutes), then go to step 2.

6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
